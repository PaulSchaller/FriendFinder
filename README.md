# FriendFinder

This is a very thorough computer program that handles data stored in the back-end through various channels to the front-end where users interact with a webpage. 

The user is given a survey of questions dealing with interests and likes.  The results of this survey are analyed with the surveys taken by other people.  Through analysis of the lack of differences between people's answers, the best match of a "friend" is determined for the user.

*node.js* serves as the gateway for this program.  Various npm packages are needed for the program.  A file of previous survey results is also needed in a database.

I deployed this program to heroku and the user can access it with the link https://pacific-earth-62047.herokuapp.com/
